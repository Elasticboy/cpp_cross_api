[dependencies]
    # Manual adjust file implicit dependencies, add (+), remove (-), or overwrite (=)
    # hello.h + hello_imp.cpp hello_imp2.cpp
    # *.h + *.cpp
    #src/text_to_speech.h + src/windows/text_to_speech_windows.cpp src/unix/text_to_speech_unix.cpp

[mains]
    # Manual adjust of files that define an executable
    # !main.cpp  # Do not build executable from this file
    # main2.cpp # Build it (it doesnt have a main() function, but maybe it includes it)

[tests]
    # Manual adjust of files that define a CTest test
    # test/* pattern to evaluate this test/ folder sources like tests

[hooks]
    # These are defined equal to [dependencies],files names matching bii*stage*hook.py
    # will be launched as python scripts at stage = {post_process, clean}
    # CMakeLists.txt + bii/my_post_process1_hook.py bii_clean_hook.py

[includes]
    # Mapping of include patterns to external blocks
    # hello*.h: user3/depblock  # includes will be processed as user3/depblock/hello*.h
	*.h: cyrillrx/utils/src

[data]
    # Manually define data files dependencies, that will be copied to bin for execution
    # By default they are copied to bin/user/block/... which should be taken into account
    # when loading from disk such data
    # image.cpp + image.jpg  # code should write open("user/block/image.jpg")
